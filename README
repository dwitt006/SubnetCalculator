INTRODUCTION
============

SubnetCalculator is an educational application that calculates the numerous
variables of a subnet. It takes input from the user and provides a step by
step solution.  

REQUIREMENTS
============

* Developed with python 3.5.2
* Environment capable of using Tkinter, Tcl/Tk

INSTALLATION
============

* python setup.py install
* ex:
*   c:\> [Directory Path\]python3 setup.py install
*      $ [Directory Path/]python3 setup.py install

OPERATION
=========

* SubnetCalc
* ex:
*   c:\> SubnetCalc
*      $ SubnetCalc

* For widgets with entries:
*   Type proper input into widget
*   Click calculate button
*   If reusing same widget, click calculate 2nd time to clear output

* Proper input ex:
*            CIDR Address: 152.2.136.0/26
*         Network Address: 152.2.136.0
*                 Netmask: 255.255.255.192
*       Broadcast Address: 152.2.136.63
*     Assignable IP Range: 152.2.136.1-152.2.136.62
*        Total Host Count: 64
*   Assignable Host Count: 62

DEFINITIONS
===========

* Assignable Host Count -- Address count within assignable IP range
* Assignable IP Range   -- IP addresses open for assignment; excluding Network and Broadcast
* Broadcast Address     -- Reserved address for contacting all assignable IP
* CIDR Address          -- Classless Inter-Domain Routing address
* Netmask               -- IP address used to determine a subnet's range of IPs
* Network Address       -- Address that identifies the Subnet on the network
* Total Host Count      -- Address count of all IPs; including Network and Broadcast
